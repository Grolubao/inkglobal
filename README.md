inkglobal
=========

inkglobal weather station test


1. Instructions
------------------------------------------

In order to run the application one needs to deploy the inkglobal folder to a Web Server such as Tomcat and access the index.html


Example: http://localhost:9080/inkglobal/index.html


NOTE: The application cannot run without a Web Server since it needs to perform a JSONP call to the weather station


2. Improvements for the future
------------------------------------------
- Minify and compress the resources using tools like Grunt
- Further improve the UI
- Create automated tests to test the layout
